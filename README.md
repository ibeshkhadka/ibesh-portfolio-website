One folder, one website, two apps:

- `apps/outer` — 3D room shell (Three.js + custom Webpack). Served at `/`.
- `apps/inner` — 2D OS site shown on the desk monitor (Create React App). Served same-origin at `/os`.
- `server/index.js` — unified Express server: outer at `/`, inner at `/os`, contact API at `POST /api/send-email`.

Why one folder: single clone, single `npm run dev` / `npm run build`, single deploy, and the monitor iframe is same-origin (`/os`) instead of a separate domain — no CORS/postMessage hassles, one set of env vars.

## Dev (2 terminals or one command)

```bash
npm install                  # root (concurrently only)
npm install --prefix apps/outer
npm install --prefix apps/inner

npm run dev                  # runs outer (:8081) + inner (:3000) together
```

Open the outer dev server (it logs the URL, e.g. `http://192.168.x.x:8081`).
Append `?dev` to use the live inner site: `http://192.168.x.x:8081?dev`
→ the monitor iframe loads `http://localhost:3000/` instead of `/os/`.

## Prod

```bash
npm run build   # builds outer → apps/outer/public + inner → apps/inner/build
FOLIO_EMAIL=ibeshkhadka35@gmail.com FOLIO_PASSWORD=<gmail-app-password> npm start
```

- Outer: `http://localhost:8080/`
- Inner: `http://localhost:8080/os/`

## Notes

- `apps/inner` uses `"homepage": "."` (relative asset paths) so the same build
  works in dev (`npm run start`, served at `/`) and in prod under `/os`.
  All `react-router` imports come from `react-router-dom` — do **not** add a
  separate `react-router` dependency (two copies break routing context).
- `apps/outer` monitor (`src/Application/World/MonitorScreen.ts`): prod iframe = `/os/`, `?dev` = `http://localhost:3000/`.
- Contact form mails to `ibeshkhadka35@gmail.com` via `FOLIO_EMAIL` / `FOLIO_PASSWORD`.
- Original repos: outer 3D shell + `portfolio-inner-site` 2D OS (Henry Heffernan, MIT). Rebranded for Ibesh Khadka.
